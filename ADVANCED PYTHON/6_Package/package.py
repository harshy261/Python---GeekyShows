# Packages are way of structuring Python's module namespaces by using "dotted module names"

# A package can have one or more modules which means, a package is collection of modules and packages.
# A package can contain packages.
# Package is nothing but a Directory/Folder

# -----> Creating Package
# 1. MUST contain a special file called __init__.py

# __all__ --> it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when from package import * is encountered. 
# EX --> __all__ = ['dashboard', 'service', 'product']
