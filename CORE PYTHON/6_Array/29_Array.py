# Array can store one type of data

# Size of array is not fixed in Python. Array can increase or decrease their size dynamically.

# Array and List are not same.

# Array uses less memory than list.


stu_roll = array('i', [101,102,103,104,105])        # we cannot use array without importing array module.
for element in stu_roll:
    print(element)
print("Code Ended")


# Type of Array:
# 1. 1-D Array
# 2. 2-D Array  ---- Python does not support Multi-Dimensional Array but we can create it using numpy package.
