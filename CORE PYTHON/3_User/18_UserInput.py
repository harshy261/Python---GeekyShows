# How to take input from User

# Input is changed into String.... then it needs to be transformed into desired form by type conversion

mobile = input("Enter your Mobile number : ")
print(mobile)
print("Your mobile is ",mobile)

# FOR TYPE CASTING
mobileInt = int(mobile)             # This will change string into int 

mobile = int(input("Enter Your Mobile: ")) 
mobile = float(input("Enter Your Mobile: ")) 
mobile = complex(input("Enter Your Mobile: ")) 
print(type(mobile))
